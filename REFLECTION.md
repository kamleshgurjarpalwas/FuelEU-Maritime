# REFLECTION

## What I Learned Using AI Agents
Working with AI agents helped me understand how automation can speed up both backend and frontend development. I learned how to structure APIs efficiently, debug issues faster, and follow cleaner coding practices. The AI provided real-time suggestions, documentation help, and clear explanations that improved my understanding of how the system works end-to-end.

## Efficiency Gains vs Manual Coding
Using AI saved a lot of time compared to manual coding. It helped me generate boilerplate code quickly, resolve errors faster, and focus more on logic and integration rather than repetitive tasks. Tasks that would have taken hours were completed in minutes. It also improved accuracy and reduced bugs during setup.

## Improvements I’d Make Next Time
Next time, I’d plan the architecture more clearly before implementation — especially for frontend-backend data flow. I’d also use version control (Git) from the start to manage iterations better. Additionally, I’d explore using AI for testing automation and documentation generation to improve overall quality and maintainability.
